# Blood Formal Verification Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2026-03-04
**Status:** Authoritative — this is the single source of truth for Blood's formal verification plan

---

## Purpose

This document defines every formal proof needed to demonstrate that Blood's feature
combination is internally consistent, safe, and compositionally sound. It is organized
into three tiers reflecting increasing specificity to Blood:

- **Tier 1 — Core Calculus Soundness:** Standard PL metatheory (progress, preservation,
  effect safety, etc.). Necessary but not differentiating — any well-designed language
  should have these.

- **Tier 2 — Feature Interaction Theorems:** Proofs that require *multiple Blood features
  to even state*. These are what make Blood Blood, not "any effects+linearity language."

- **Tier 3 — Composition Theorems:** Proofs that Blood's features compose simultaneously
  to produce emergent safety guarantees no individual feature provides alone. These are
  the crown jewels that validate Blood's design thesis.

### Why Three Tiers?

No single Blood feature is unprecedented — Koka has effects, Rust has linear types, Julia
has multiple dispatch, Cyclone had regions. Blood's thesis is that the *composition* of
these features produces emergent safety guarantees that no individual feature provides
alone. Tier 1 proves each feature works. Tier 2 proves features interact safely in pairs.
Tier 3 proves the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Complete before extending.** Admitted theorems weaken safety claims — building new
   features on top of unproven foundations creates false confidence.
2. **Interaction theorems over individual features.** A proof about effects alone is less
   valuable than a proof about effects+linearity together.
3. **Each phase must compile independently.** `make -f Makefile.coq` must pass after each
   phase with no new warnings.
4. **The formalization should be specifically about Blood.** By Tier 3, the proofs should
   not be describable as "a generic effects calculus."

## Current State (2026-03-04)

17 files, 7,253 lines, 4 Admitted (all in LinearSafety.v), 149 Qed, 1 Axiom, 1 Parameter.
16 of 17 files fully proved (0 Admitted).

### Permanent Modeling Assumptions

These are deliberate abstractions, not proof gaps:

| Item | File | Kind | Rationale |
|------|------|------|-----------|
| `continuation_expr_is_value` | Inversion.v | Axiom | Continuations abstract over expression structure |
| `extract_gen_refs` | Semantics.v | Parameter | Snapshot extraction abstracted at interface level |

---

## Tier 1: Core Calculus Soundness

Standard PL metatheory. Proves the core calculus is well-behaved.

### Phase 1: Core Safety Foundation — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Fully mechanized Wright-Felleisen type soundness.

**Status:** All sub-tasks completed. 0 Admitted.

| Theorem | File | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Progress (all 11 cases) | Progress.v | PROVED |
| Preservation (all 11 cases) | Preservation.v | PROVED |
| `type_soundness_full` | Soundness.v | PROVED |
| `full_composition_safety` | Soundness.v | PROVED |
| Typing inversion (21 lemmas) | Inversion.v | PROVED |
| Substitution preservation (21 lemmas) | Substitution.v | PROVED |
| Shift-substitution commutation (4 lemmas) | ShiftSubst.v | PROVED |
| Effect row algebra (7 lemmas) | EffectAlgebra.v | PROVED |
| Context typing (7 lemmas) | ContextTyping.v | PROVED |

Key techniques for the hardest cases:
- HandleOpDeep/HandleOpShallow: continuation typing via `weakening_cons` +
  `delimited_context_typing_gen` + double substitution (kont at index 1, v at index 0)
- T_Record: mutual induction scheme with record field progress property
- T_Handle perform: `String.string_dec` for decidable effect name comparison,
  `DC_HandleOther` + `dc_no_match` for unhandled operations escaping through handler

### Phase 3: Effect Safety — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Prove effects are tracked, contained, and handled.

**Status:** All 9 theorems proved. 0 Admitted.

| Theorem | File | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| `static_effect_containment` | EffectSafety.v | PROVED |
| `dynamic_effect_containment` | EffectSafety.v | PROVED |
| `deep_handler_reinstallation` | EffectSafety.v | PROVED |
| `effect_handling_completeness` | EffectSafety.v | PROVED |
| `pure_subset_all` | EffectSafety.v | PROVED |
| `effect_entries_subset_union_compat` | EffectSafety.v | PROVED |
| `effect_union_monotone_left` | EffectSafety.v | PROVED |
| `effect_union_comm` | EffectSafety.v | PROVED |
| `effect_discipline` | EffectSafety.v | PROVED |

### Phase 4: Generation Snapshot Safety — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Prove generational references prevent use-after-free across effect continuations.

**Status:** All 14 theorems proved. 0 Admitted. Blood's most novel formal contribution —
no published precedent exists for generation snapshot safety with algebraic effects.

| Theorem | File | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| `no_use_after_free` | GenerationSnapshots.v | PROVED |
| `gen_snapshot_valid` | GenerationSnapshots.v | PROVED |
| `effects_gen_composition_safety` | Soundness.v | PROVED |
| + 11 supporting lemmas | GenerationSnapshots.v | PROVED |

---

## Tier 2: Feature Interaction Theorems

Proofs that require multiple Blood features to state. Each theorem captures a property
that emerges from the interaction of two or more features.

### Phase 2: Effects x Linearity — IN PROGRESS (4 Admitted)

**Goal:** Prove that algebraic effects and linear/affine types compose safely. Multi-shot
handlers cannot capture linear values; single-shot handlers can. At `perform`, linear
values are transferred (not duplicated) via context splitting.

**Why this is a Tier 2 theorem, not Tier 1:** Koka has effects but no linearity. Rust has
linearity but no effects. When you combine them, the question is: "What happens when a
handler resumes a continuation twice, and that continuation holds a linear resource?"
Blood's answer — enforced by the type system — is: you can't. This is a property that
*neither system alone needs to state*.

**Depends on:** Phase 1 (SATISFIED)

**File:** LinearSafety.v (4 Admitted -> 0)

| Theorem | Status | Proof Strategy |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| `linear_single_shot_safe` | Qed (placeholder) | Strengthen conclusion |
| `linear_safety_complete` | Qed (placeholder) | Strengthen conclusion |
| `linear_safety_static` | **ADMITTED** | Induction on typing derivation with context splitting |
| `affine_safety_static` | **ADMITTED** | Similar, allowing Split_Affine_Neither |
| `multishot_no_linear_capture` | **ADMITTED** | Handler well-formedness blocks linear capture |
| `effect_suspension_linear_safety` | **ADMITTED** | Context splitting at perform preserves linearity |

Note: `linear_single_shot_safe` and `linear_safety_complete` are Qed but with trivial
(`True`) conclusions. Strengthening to meaningful statements is part of this phase.

**Blocking issue:** The 4 theorems are NOT provable with current typing rules.
T_Var doesn't check Delta, T_Const accepts any Delta, and a concrete counter-example
exists (see LinearSafety.v header). Closing these requires:

1. Strengthening typing rules: T_Var (+2 premises), T_Const (+1 premise),
   RFT_Cons (+lin_split), HWF (+multishot restriction)
2. Breaking `has_type_lin_irrelevant` in Substitution.v — the foundational lemma
   proving typing is independent of Delta. This becomes FALSE with linearity-aware
   leaf rules.
3. Cascading through every `has_type_mut_ind` user: Substitution.v, Inversion.v,
   ContextTyping.v, Preservation.v, Progress.v
4. Adding a linearity-introduction mechanism (T_Lam/T_Let currently always use
   `Lin_Unrestricted` — no way to introduce linear bindings for closed terms)

**Estimated:** ~500-1000 lines changed across 8 existing files (typing rule redesign,
not additive proof work)

### Phase 5: Regions x Generations — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Prove region deallocation is safe via generation bumps.

**Status:** All 3 main theorems + 1 nested safety corollary proved. 0 Admitted.

**Depends on:** Phase 4 (SATISFIED)

**New file:** Regions.v (316 lines, 10 Qed)

Self-contained — builds on GenerationSnapshots.v infrastructure without modifying
existing files. Region destruction is modeled as bulk generation-bump, which is the
key insight from FORMAL_SEMANTICS.md §5.8: "Region safety is NOT a typing property —
it is a runtime property guaranteed by the generation system."

| Theorem | File | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| `region_safety` | Regions.v | PROVED |
| `region_effect_safety` | Regions.v | PROVED |
| `escape_analysis_sound` | Regions.v | PROVED |
| `region_nested_safety` | Regions.v | PROVED (bonus) |

### Phase 6: Dispatch x Type Stability — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Formalize dispatch resolution and prove type stability.

**Status:** All 3 main theorems + 1 corollary proved. 0 Admitted.

**Depends on:** Phase 1 (SATISFIED)

**New file:** Dispatch.v (289 lines, 11 Qed)

Self-contained — parameterized over a subtype relation via Section variables.
When Blood's concrete subtype relation is defined, instantiate by closing the
Section. Section hypotheses: subtype relation (5 properties), method_eq_dec (1).

| Theorem | File | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| `dispatch_determinism` | Dispatch.v | PROVED |
| `type_stability_soundness` | Dispatch.v | PROVED |
| `dispatch_preserves_typing` | Dispatch.v | PROVED |
| `dispatch_return_type_determined` | Dispatch.v | PROVED (bonus) |

### Phase 7: MVS x Linearity — NOT STARTED

**Goal:** Formalize copy-by-default (mutable value semantics) and explicit borrowing.
Prove value types never alias.

**Why this is Tier 2:** In Rust, linearity means "move" — the original binding is
consumed. In Blood, linearity means "use exactly once" but the value was *copied in*, so
the original is independent. This is a fundamentally different resource model. The proof
shows MVS + linearity = no-aliasing guarantee without Rust's ownership complexity.

**Depends on:** Phase 2 (linear safety for borrow tracking)

**New file:** ValueSemantics.v

| Theorem | File | Proof Strategy |
|---------|------|----------------|
| `value_copy_independence` | ValueSemantics.v | Copying a value type creates an independent value |
| `borrow_linearity` | ValueSemantics.v | Mutable borrows are linear, immutable borrows unrestricted |
| `mvs_no_aliasing` | ValueSemantics.v | Value-typed bindings never alias |

Note: The core insight (values are copied by substitution) is already implicit in the
de Bruijn formalization. This phase makes it explicit.

**Estimated:** ~200-300 new lines

---

## Tier 3: Composition Theorems

Proofs that Blood's features compose *simultaneously* to produce emergent safety
guarantees. These are the crown jewels — they demonstrate that the whole is greater
than the sum of its parts.

### Phase 8: Effects Subsume Control Flow Patterns — NOT STARTED

**Goal:** Prove that Blood's algebraic effects + handlers can express exceptions,
async/await, and generators as special cases, with all safety guarantees (effect
containment, linear safety, generation safety) applying automatically.

**Why this matters:** This shows effects aren't just another feature — they're a unifying
framework. Instead of having separate mechanisms for exceptions, async, and generators
(each needing its own safety proof), Blood has one mechanism with one set of proofs
covering all patterns.

**Depends on:** Phase 2 (linear safety), Phase 3 (effect safety)

**New file:** EffectSubsumption.v

| Theorem | Proof Strategy |
|---------|----------------|
| `effects_subsume_exceptions` | Exception handling is a specialization of effect handling with a single `raise` operation and no resume |
| `effects_subsume_generators` | Generators are effect handlers that yield values and resume with unit; prove bisimulation with iterator protocol |
| `effects_subsume_async` | Async/await is a specialization of shallow effect handling with a suspend/resume protocol |
| `subsumption_safety_transfer` | Safety theorems (containment, linearity, generation) apply to all subsumed patterns without additional proof |

**Estimated:** ~200-300 new lines

### Phase 9: Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection — NOT STARTED

**Goal:** Prove that Regions + Generations + Linearity + MVS together guarantee memory
safety without garbage collection.

**Why this matters:** This is Blood's headline claim against GC-based languages. The proof
shows that every allocation is either: (a) stack-allocated and scoped, (b) region-
allocated and invalidated on region destroy, or (c) persistent and reference-counted —
and that generations + linearity prevent use-after-free in all three tiers.

**Depends on:** Phase 2 (linearity), Phase 4 (SATISFIED), Phase 5 (SATISFIED), Phase 7 (MVS)

**New file:** MemorySafety.v

| Theorem | Proof Strategy |
|---------|----------------|
| `tier_coverage` | Every allocation belongs to exactly one tier (Stack, Region, Persistent) |
| `stack_safety` | Stack-tier values are scoped; no dangling references after scope exit |
| `region_safety_composition` | Region-tier values detected stale via generation bump (combines Phase 5 `region_safety` with Phase 4 `no_use_after_free`) |
| `persistent_safety` | Persistent-tier values are reference-counted; generation checked on access |
| `memory_safety_no_gc` | **Composition theorem:** Union of tier guarantees covers all memory, no GC required |

**Estimated:** ~150-250 new lines (heavy lifting done in Phases 2, 4, 5, 7; this stitches them together)

### Phase 10: Tier-Based Concurrency Safety — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Prove that Blood's tier-based crossing rules guarantee safe concurrency without
Rust-style Send/Sync traits.

**Status:** All 5 main theorems + 3 corollaries proved. 0 Admitted.

**Depends on:** Phase 5 (SATISFIED)

**New file:** FiberSafety.v (412 lines, 13 Qed)

Self-contained — defines memory tiers (Stack, Region, Persistent), mutability (Mutable,
Frozen), typed references, and fiber crossing predicates. Builds on Regions.v for the
region-checked crossing theorem. Ownership model parameterized via Section variable
(addr_owner), same pattern as Dispatch.v.

Key insight (CONCURRENCY.md §9.2): Data race freedom follows by construction from the
tier crossing rules. Mutable references require address ownership (unique per fiber),
so two different fibers cannot both hold writable references to the same address.

| Theorem | File | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| `stack_no_cross` | FiberSafety.v | PROVED |
| `region_checked_cross` | FiberSafety.v | PROVED |
| `persistent_free_cross` | FiberSafety.v | PROVED |
| `tier_crossing_safety` | FiberSafety.v | PROVED |
| `region_isolation` | FiberSafety.v | PROVED |
| `region_isolation_no_write` | FiberSafety.v | PROVED (bonus) |
| `region_crossing_detected` | FiberSafety.v | PROVED (bonus) |
| `crossing_region_is_frozen` | FiberSafety.v | PROVED (bonus) |

### Phase 11: Full Composition Safety — NOT STARTED

**Goal:** Prove that ALL of Blood's safety properties hold simultaneously under arbitrary
composition of features.

**Why this matters:** This is the crown jewel of the entire verification effort. Individual
proofs show each property holds in isolation. Pairwise proofs show features interact
safely. This proof shows they don't interfere with each other when all present
simultaneously — adding regions doesn't break effect safety, adding dispatch doesn't
break linear safety, etc.

**Depends on:** All previous phases (2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

**New file:** CompositionSafety.v

| Theorem | Proof Strategy |
|---------|----------------|
| `type_soundness_extended` | Progress + Preservation hold for the extended calculus (regions, dispatch, MVS, tiers) |
| `effect_safety_preserved` | Effect containment and handling still hold with all extensions |
| `linear_safety_preserved` | Linear/affine guarantees hold with regions, dispatch, and MVS |
| `generation_safety_preserved` | Generation snapshot validity holds with regions and tiers |
| `full_blood_safety` | **Master theorem:** conjunction of type soundness + effect safety + linear safety + generation safety + region safety + dispatch determinism + MVS no-aliasing + tier crossing safety |

**Estimated:** ~100-200 new lines (this is mostly combining existing results)

---

## What NOT to Formalize

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Content-addressing (BLAKE3) | Implementation property about hash determinism, not type safety |
| Full fiber scheduler (M:N) | Phase 10 covers the crossing rules; the scheduler is runtime implementation detail |
| Structured concurrency | Requires process calculus or interaction trees; massive standalone effort |
| Macro expansion | Pre-type-checking source transformation; orthogonal to safety |
| Bridge FFI | Operates at ABI boundary, outside type-safe core |
| Escape analysis algorithm | Compiler implementation detail; Phase 5 formalizes the soundness guarantee, not the algorithm |
| Concrete `extract_gen_refs` | Abstract interface sufficient for all safety proofs; concretization is optional |

### Parallelism Opportunities

These phases can proceed in parallel:
- Phase 7 + Phase 8 (both depend only on Phase 2)
- Phase 9 (Phase 5 complete; Phase 10 now also complete)

### Critical Path

The longest dependency chain is:

```
Phase 2 → Phase 7 → Phase 9 → Phase 11
```

Phase 2 (Linear Safety) is the bottleneck — it blocks Phases 7, 8, 9, and (transitively) 11.
**Warning:** Phase 2 is a typing rule redesign that touches every existing proof file.
It breaks `has_type_lin_irrelevant` (Substitution.v), cascading through all mutual
induction proofs. Should be done on a branch with incremental verification. See
LinearSafety.v header for the full Phase M3 plan and counter-example.

Projected final: ~8,400-9,300 lines, 21+ files, zero Admitted.

Note: Phase 2 estimate is "lines changed" not "lines added" — it modifies 8 existing
files extensively. Net line count increase may be lower than the change count suggests.

## Classification of Non-Qed Items

### Modeling Axioms (permanent, by design)

| Item | File | Rationale |
|------|------|-----------|
| `continuation_expr_is_value` | Inversion.v | Deliberate abstraction over continuation structure |
| `extract_gen_refs` | Semantics.v | Abstract snapshot extraction interface |

### Genuine Proof Obligations (require Phase M3 typing rule changes)

These 4 theorems are NOT provable with the current typing rules. T_Var does not
check Delta, T_Const accepts any Delta, and a concrete counter-example exists
(see LinearSafety.v header). Closing them requires strengthening leaf typing rules,
breaking `has_type_lin_irrelevant`, and cascading through all mutual induction proofs.

| Item | File | Strategy |
|------|------|----------|
| `linear_safety_static` | LinearSafety.v | Requires T_Var/T_Const to check Delta; induction on typing with context splitting |
| `affine_safety_static` | LinearSafety.v | Same prerequisite; allows Split_Affine_Neither |
| `multishot_no_linear_capture` | LinearSafety.v | Requires HWF multishot restriction premise |
| `effect_suspension_linear_safety` | LinearSafety.v | Requires T_Var to check Delta; context splitting at perform |

### Formalization Gaps

NONE REMAINING — all formalization gaps have been resolved.

---

## Verification Protocol

### After Each Phase

```bash
cd proofs/theories
eval $(opam env --switch=blood-proofs)
coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile.coq
make -f Makefile.coq
```

Confirm:
1. Zero new warnings or errors
2. `grep -c "Admitted." *.v` shows expected count (decreasing toward 0)
3. New files added to `_CoqProject` in correct dependency order

### After All Tier 2 Phases

- Zero Admitted in LinearSafety.v
- All pairwise interaction theorems proved
- `make -f Makefile.coq` clean build

### After All Phases (Final Verification)

- Zero Admitted across entire proof suite (excluding permanent modeling axioms)
- Every safety property Blood claims in its specs has a corresponding proven Coq theorem
- The formalization is specifically about Blood (not a generic effects calculus)
- `full_blood_safety` in CompositionSafety.v is Qed — the master composition theorem
